This section includes past coursework and will be updated to include code samples during the upcoming academic year.

### Macroeconomics II *(Spring 2024)*
This course, instructed by [Jean Barth√©lemy](https://sites.google.com/site/jeanbarthelemyeconomist/home), covered real business cycle theory and New Keynesian models. With my co-presentors Tanfei Li and Tianxiang Yuan, we presented [*Menu Costs and Phillips Curves*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/512625) by Golosov and Lucas (JPE, 2007). This paper analyzes how a fixed cost of price changes, as opposed to Calvo repricing probabilities, affects impulse reponses in a standard New Keynesian Framework in which firms face aggregate money supply and idiosyncratic technology shocks.

### Microeconomics II *(Spring 2024)*
This course in microeconomics specifically dealt with Game Theory and required us to develop our own gane applied to a real-world example using the tools and material acquired during the course, supervised by [Emeric Henry](https://sites.google.com/site/emericmlhenry/home). We focused on strategic interactions between a profit-maximizing firm and an environmentally-concious government to discuss how governments can implement "optimal" taxation to encourage firms to decrease pollution during production. We first describe an equilibrium outcome under perfect information, before introducing informational asymmetries modelled by a signalling game.

Our research report is available [here](/files/CHAMBON_GUGELMO_PAVLOVICH_SOUFFLET.pdf) and on our dedicated [project website](https://www.paulogcd.com/Micro_project/) maintained by my friend and co-author [Paulo Gugelmo Cavalheiro Dias.](https://www.paulogcd.com/)
