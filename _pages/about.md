👋 Nice to meet you! 

📚 I hold a master's degree in Economics from [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-recherche/en/academics/masters/master-economics/). My interests lie in macroeconomics, monetary policy and economic history. My master's thesis was awarded the [best thesis prize](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-recherche/en/academics/masters/master-economics/best-thesis/) by the Sciences Po Department of Economics.

👨‍💻 Currently, I am a trainee at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html). Previously, I worked as research assistant at the Sciences Po Department of Economics and was an intern at Deutsche Bundesbank.
