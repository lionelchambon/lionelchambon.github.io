👋 Nice to meet you! 

📚 I hold a master's degree in Economics from [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-recherche/en/academics/masters/master-economics/). My interests lie in macroeconomics, monetary policy and economic history.

👨‍💻 I am an incoming trainee at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) and currently work as a research assistant at the Sciences Po Department of Economics. Previously, I was an intern at Deutsche Bundesbank.
