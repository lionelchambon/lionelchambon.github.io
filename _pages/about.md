Nice to meet you! 

I am currently a  second-year master's student in Economics at the Sciences Po School of Research. My interests lie in macroeconomics, monetary policy and international capital flows. This summer, I will be an intern at the German Federal Reserve ([Deutsche Bundesbank](https://www.bundesbank.de)).

Feel free to reach out!
