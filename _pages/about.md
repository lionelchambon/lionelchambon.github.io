Nice to meet you! I am currently a  second-year master's student in Economics at the Sciences Po School of Research. My interests lie in macroeconomics, monetary policy and international capital flows. This summer, I will be an intern at the German Federal Reserve (Deutsche Bundesbank). Feel free to reach out!
