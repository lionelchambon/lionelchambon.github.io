### Investigating Private Consumption in the Euro Area *(Summer 2024, Deutsche Bundesbank)*
As an intern at the DG Economics of the Bundesbank, I researched current dynamics of private consumption in the Euro area. Two main questions were of interest: first, whether the *long run* relationship between private consumption and its determinants had changed since the COVID-19 pandemic, and second, how short-run consumption fluctuations since 2020 could be explained. *More details will be available soon.*
