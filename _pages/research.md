### Working Papers

### Unpublished Works

**Master's Thesis** Can rearmament boost employment? I estimate the causal effect of military spending on unemployment in Nazi Germany between 1932 and 1936, using novel archival data on the German Luftwaffe. Exploiting cross-district variation in exposure to rearmament, I estimate the impact of military procurement on local labor market outcomes. I find significant relative employment effects of approximately 3 percentage points.

**Bundesbank Internship Project** As an intern at the DG Economics of the Bundesbank, I researched current dynamics of private consumption in the Euro area. To do so, I estimated an error-correction model (ECM) using macro time-series and performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on consumer survey data. I find significant changes in the long-run relationship between consumption and its determinants, driven by income and financial wealth variables.
